# ACDH virtual Open Data hackathon series 2019: ELEXIS hack
The repo containing your task for the first hackathon in the ACDH hackathon series 2019: ELEXIS hack. This task is open for submissions from Feb 04, 2019 (2 p.m. CET) to Feb 20, 2019 (midnight CET). 

## Your task

The first hack of the ACDH virtual hackathon series focuses on Open Data that is of interest for the [ELEXIS](https://elex.is/) project. In this hack, your task is to develop a creative mode of processing a lexicographical dataset. It is your decision what to do with the data: You could enrich it, visualize it, do statistical analysis, integrate/aggregate it with other resources (e.g. LOD) or develop an innovative application to explore it. 

The dataset to be worked on in this task is the *Digital Dictionary of Tunis Arabic*. This set of [XML/TEI](http://www.tei-c.org/guidelines/) data was not only built on data from the corpus of spoken language that was compiled in the [TuniCo](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/projects/tunico/) project, but also on a range of additional sources: data elicited from complementary interviews with young Tunisians and lexical material taken from various published historical sources dating from the middle of the 20th century and earlier. Several frontends to this dataset already exist. To get an overview, have a look at this website:
https://tunico.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/about_dictionary.html

The dataset is available for download here:
https://id.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/uuid/175b8cdf-5d04-f4d3-a778-67910aa8fd37

It is a single XML file following the [TEI schema](http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/). It consists of two parts. The first part contains in a dictionary with each term providing basic grammatical information as well as meanings in three languages (English, German & French). Some terms are illustrated with sample phrases and/or links to the second part of the dictionary. The second part contains usage examples taken from the spoken language. Each example is a short sentence with English, German & French translations. 

## What your submission should contain

Each submission has to include code, an instruction on how to run it (readme), a short presentation of what was done (in a format of your choice: poster, video, description,...), enriched data (if applicable) and statistics on the data (if applicable).

## Judgement criteria

Your submission will be judged by the following criteria:
* Creativity, innovation  (e.g. Is the approach/idea new and unique? Does it do something that hasnâ€™t been done before? Does it provide new insights into the data? Does the hack provide a new/faster/clearer solution to the old problem?)
* Accessibility, reusability, reproducibility (e.g. Is the code properly documented? Is the technical approach reproducible?)
* Elegance (e.g. Is the code easy to modify and reuse? Is it readable for others? Is modularity considered in the design? Is the code simple and concise?)

## Openness

Participants will work on their solutions in a dedicated (own) GitHub repository. Once you have finished your work, set your repo to public, tag it #ACDHhackathonELEXIS and send the repo link to vanessa.hannesschlaeger[at]oeaw.ac.at and tanja.wissik[at]oeaw.ac.at.

All code submitted by all participants (as well as all reviews by all judges) shall be made permanently publicly available on GitHub under an MIT license (or similarly permissive license, respectively a fitting open license for submissions of enriched data and presentation material). By submitting their code to this challange, participants agree to these terms.
