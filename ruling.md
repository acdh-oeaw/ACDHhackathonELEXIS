# Reason
## Summary
There were two submissions for the ELEXIS hackathon, which invited participants to develop creative methods to process the [TuniCo dictionary](https://tunico.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/about_dictionary.html). Thomas Burch and Li Sheng have created [TAGEF-Net](https://github.com/ThomasBurch/ELEXIS-Hackathon) (Tunis Arabic German English French Network); a web based network visualisation of the dictionary, while Irina Treichl has created [TuniCo Roots](https://github.com/citime/hackathon-elexis-2019) - an interface for filtering and visualising the data by radical consonants, their position in the word and the roots of words in the dictionary. TAGEF-Net serves as a general purpose exploratory tool and TuniCo Roots allows more specific ways to explore patterns in the lexicon using consonants and roots. Both submissions have different strengths and weaknesses and owing to the difference in the ideas themselves, we are unable to pick a winner and runner up. Therefore we recommend both submissions to share the first place.
## Creativity
Both submissions shine in this aspect. TuniCo Roots provides insights into the dataset via the consonant position and word roots and TAGEF-Net shows the relationship between the roots of words across languages. Even though the TuniCo dictionary has several frontends already, their interfaces present new and interesting ways to explore the data for academics and non-experts alike. The TAGEF-Net team has also performed and presented basic statistical analysis of the data, which is appreciated.
## Reproducibility
TAGEF-Net - in part thanks to its technology stack (nodejs and python) was incredibly easy to setup and run. It was also very well documented. Some functionalities in the interface itself did not work as intended though. As for TuniCo Roots - some of the judges were entirely unable to get it up and running; the deployment instructions could have been better documented. We rank TAGEF-Net better than TuniCo Roots for this reason.
## Reusability
Reusability is not the highest priority in hackathons in general - as they are usually an opportunity to prototype ideas and not to develop production ready systems. Despite that both submissions make use of functions that could potentially be reused. As they stand, it is hard to reuse any of the submitted code by simply pointing to a different dataset in a similar format without some modifications.
## Elegance
They have both chosen the tools for the task appropriately and their application interfaces are modern and clean. Their code is also neatly structured and makes it easy for review. TuniCo Roots perhaps scores higher than TAGEF-Net because it also makes use of external data sources to complement the given data and due to some minor glitches in the TAGEF-Net user interface.
